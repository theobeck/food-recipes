## Project Description

Our project is a recipe-sharing platform that provides users with an immersive culinary experience. The main page features a captivating list of dish names and corresponding images. Users can easily explore more dishes by clicking a button that dynamically loads additional items. Upon selecting a dish, users are redirected to a dedicated page displaying the recipe details, including ingredients and preparation steps.

In addition to these fundamental features, we have implemented several enhancements:

- **User Reviews:** Users can leave reviews for each recipe, providing a star rating out of five and leaving comments to share their experiences.

- **Filtering and Search:** The main page offers filtering options, allowing users to specifically look for vegetarian recipes. A robust search functionality enables users to find specific recipes efficiently.

## Technical Choices

- **Backend:** The backend, hosted on a VM, is implemented using mongoDB. To run the backend locally, connect to the NTNU network or use VPN.

## How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the "Backend" folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Execute `npm start` to launch the server. (Note: Ensure connection to NTNU network or use VPN for local development).

Next:

4. Open another terminal and navigate to the project directory.
5. Run `npm install` to install required dependencies.
6. Execute `npm run dev` to start the application.
